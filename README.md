# FINANCIAL-TRANSACTIONS-ANALYSIS
This project provides an in-depth analysis of financial transactions using Power BI.
The dataset combines data from 5 different files, including two large JSON files (one containing over 1 crore rows).
Data cleaning and preparation were performed in Python, and the cleaned dataset was imported into Power BI to create this interactive report.

# Project Highlights
1. Data Sources:

- 5 files (including 2 JSON files, 1 with 1Cr+ rows).

2. Data Cleaning:

- Performed in Python (pandas, numpy).

- Handled missing values, corrected data types, removed duplicates, and optimized performance.

3. Data Storage:

- Transferred cleaned data into Power BI for visualization.

4. Dashboard Features:

- Financial Transactions Analysis

- Users Analysis

- Cards Analysis

- Year-Wise Trends

- Transaction Details

- Hierarchical Transaction Drilldown
